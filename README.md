# Acerola's Epic Color Palettes
Color palette tool used in Acerola's video:

[![Your Colors Suck (it's not your fault)](https://github.com/evannorton/Acerolas-Epic-Color-Palettes/assets/35230033/b15e985a-d5eb-47c8-9df3-3aa73e1a7b69)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-wlo8yVhk)

but with a few tweaks : all colors are generated using OKLAB/OKLCH color space, using 2 colors as input and no random values are used
